# Interview Questions
An open source solution with questions that you would expect any candidate worth hiring at a mid-level / senior role to be able to answer.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute by forking this project and adding, removing and refactoring questions as you see fit.

For your PR to be merged, it must not include any web, xamarin or 'coding street' questions. The current questionaire is just for core c# coding practices.

If you want to add questions about a 'coding street' please add a new project into the solution and prefix it with InterviewQuestions (i.e: InterviewQuestions.Web.Mvc)
